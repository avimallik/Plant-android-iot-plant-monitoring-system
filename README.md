# 🌱 Plant: Android & IoT Plant Monitoring System

**Plant** is an open-source IoT solution for real-time monitoring of your plant’s soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. It features an ESP8266/NodeMCU microcontroller (Arduino IDE) and a companion Android app for live data, alarms, and easy configuration. All data stays local on your Wi-Fi—no cloud required.

## ✨ Features

- **Live Sensor Monitoring:**  
  Real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity from your plant’s environment.
- **Customizable Alerts:**  
  Set a soil moisture threshold and get notified with a sound and warning if the plant is dry.
- **Visual Dashboard:**  
  The Android app shows live readings with color-coded status, progress bars, and warning messages.
- **LCD Status Display:**  
  NodeMCU’s LCD shows the device’s IP and connection status.
- **Simple Wi-Fi Only:**  
  Runs fully on your own Wi-Fi, no cloud/internet dependency.
- **Easy Installation & Use:**  
  Minimal hardware, clear app, no coding experience needed.

## 🖼️ System Workflow

- The **NodeMCU** reads data from the DHT11 and soil moisture sensor.
- Data is shown on the LCD display for local status.
- NodeMCU runs a simple **HTTP server** (port 80) returning JSON-formatted sensor data.
- The **Android app** fetches data every 2 seconds from NodeMCU using its IP address.
- App visualizes plant health, provides warnings, and sounds an alarm if needed.

## 🧑‍💻 Software Components

### 1. NodeMCU (ESP8266) Firmware

- Developed in Arduino IDE.
- Handles Wi-Fi connection and local server.
- Sensor reading, LCD update, and JSON data output.

**Key Libraries:**
- [ESP8266WiFi](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)
- [Adafruit DHT sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
- [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Flash NodeMCU (ESP8266)

- Connect NodeMCU to your PC via USB.
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Install required libraries and select the correct board.
- Upload the provided Arduino code.
- Open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 115200) or check the LCD for the device’s IP address.

### 2. Setup Hardware

- Wire up all sensors and the LCD as described in the wiring table above.
- Insert the sensors into your plant pot.

### 3. Build or Install Android App

- Clone or download the Android source code.
- Open the project in Android Studio.
- Build and run the app on your Android device, or install the provided APK.
- Open the app, go to **Settings**, and enter your NodeMCU’s local IP address.
- Set your desired soil moisture alarm threshold.

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Power on NodeMCU with sensors placed in the soil.
2. Wait for Wi-Fi connection. The LCD will display the IP address.
3. Start the Android app and connect using the NodeMCU’s IP.
4. View real-time plant health status on your phone.
5. If the soil moisture is below your threshold, you’ll see a warning and hear an alarm.
