# üå± Plant: Android & IoT Plant Monitoring System

**Plant** Plant is an open-source IoT solution for real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in grass and turf management. It is built on an ESP8266/NodeMCU microcontroller (Arduino IDE) with a companion Android application that provides live data visualization, configurable alerts, and user-friendly controls. Using low-cost, power-efficient sensors such as AHT-20 (Temperature and Humidity) and Analog Soil Moisture Sensor, the system achieved up to 25% water savings and reduced manual intervention by nearly 40%, while proving scalable for larger agricultural applications. This project was conducted by <b>Jaff Arena and Academy‚ÄîBangladesh‚Äôs Futsal Playground and BSD BD Ltd</b>, where this project deployed as an IoT-enabled grass or turf watering system.

## üñºÔ∏è System Workflow

- The **NodeMCU** reads data from the DHT11 and soil moisture sensor.
- Data is shown on the LCD display for local status.
- NodeMCU runs a simple **HTTP server** (port 80) returning JSON-formatted sensor data.
- The **Android app** fetches data every 2 seconds from NodeMCU using its IP address.
- App visualizes plant health, provides warnings, and sounds an alarm if needed.
